The following is a professional portfolio page. This page will serve as a portfolio where I can showcase my current works. It will be updated frequently as more projects come about. Making it a constant work in progress.

N/A

Credits
All information and steps that were taken to build the page as is, is from U Penn's coding bootcamp.
